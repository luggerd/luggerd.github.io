## Welcome to Luggerd Inc
This website will provide crucial information as to what Bitcoins are and how you can invest. My very best efforst will be used to explain as to why now is the time to invest. 

I know it may be very scary to think what will happen with your money when you invest but just think of the possibilities.

### What are Bitcoins
Bitcoins are the future of currency. In this year alone Bitcoin has grown from $985.56 (Jan 2, 2017) to $11,863.50 as of (Dec 5, 2017). 

Bitcoins are as simple as it being computer code that holds monetary value. It is the start of cryptocurrency. This currency is diffirent in that the government cannot control it. This is what makes it so special. A currency for the people by the people, with no middle man. 

### Why invest before it's too late?
Large companies such as Amazon cannot pass up on such a large investment they will soon make the move to Bitcoin. 
Think of Bitcoins as golden nuggets during the "Wild Wild West" days where you can use gold to pay and people value gold not because it's some asteriod gold but because people see those who have it as wealthy. 
As humans we value certain things and even put a price on it even though it may not actually be worth that much.
Bitcoin is growing so much and so rapidly. An incline which is so unimaginable and unprecedented. 
We have placed a huge value on Bitcoin and so many more are getting on this hype train.

### How do we invest?
The first step is accepting that Bitcoin is a currency and that it has a future.
After you accpet it then the real fun part can begin.
1. Follow the price of Bitcoin and use your better judgment to predict when it will be the perfect time to buy. (Easier said than done. However use your brain you're smart.)
2. Find a secure website to buy your Bitcoins. (Example: [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com)) The great thing about Bitcoin is that you don't have to payout $11,000 to get your share. You can do anything from $50 to $11,000.
3. Go to find yourself a simple and secure physical Bitcoin wallet. (Example: [Trezor](http://a.co/9hV2qrt))
4. You may also want to download the [Blockchain](https://blockchain.info/) Application on your phone.
5. Learn how to use and transfer Bitcoin from your account to your [Trezor wallet](https://youtu.be/So42CYoQi4k) and or Blockchain virtual wallet.
6. Keep your Trezor under safeguard (In a safe maybe?) and make sure you don't lose any security codes attachede to it.
7. Don't be afraid if the price goes down. By the year 2035 you may be able to buy a full house with just one Bitcoin alone. 
So don't sell!!! Invest!!!
