### How do we invest?
The first step is accepting that Bitcoin is a currency and that it has a future.
After you accpet it then the real fun part can begin.
1. Follow the price of Bitcoin and use your better judgment to predict when it will be the perfect time to buy. (Easier said than done. However use your brain you're smart.)
2. Find a secure website to buy your Bitcoins. (Example: [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com)) The great thing about Bitcoin is that you don't have to payout $11,000 to get your share. You can do anything from $50 to $11,000.
3. Go to find yourself a simple and secure physical Bitcoin wallet. (Example: [Trezor](http://a.co/9hV2qrt))
4. You may also want to download the [Blockchain](https://blockchain.info/) Application on your phone.
5. Learn how to use and transfer Bitcoin from your account to your [Trezor wallet](https://youtu.be/So42CYoQi4k) and or Blockchain virtual wallet.
6. Keep your Trezor under safeguard (In a safe maybe?) and make sure you don't lose any security codes attachede to it.
7. Don't be afraid if the price goes down. By the year 2035 you may be able to buy a full house with just one Bitcoin alone. 
So don't sell!!! Invest!!!
